        <p class="tx">Research &ldquo;the key to success&rdquo; and you will find that sources consistently agree that
          planning and goal setting are paramount to success. Very few people set out on a road trip purely for the sake
          of the drive. You must have a destination in mind to know whether you&rsquo;ve arrived, and a map will
          indicate whether you&rsquo;re headed in the right direction. Similarly, you paint a picture of success when
          you set a goal such that you know what it looks like and can identify when you&rsquo;ve achieved it. Planning
          and goal setting help you gauge your progress and know whether you&rsquo;re on track. Goals and plans also
          help you decide when it&rsquo;s time to celebrate or when it&rsquo;s time to adjust your efforts and redirect
          your time. </p>
        <p class="tx">This chapter explores these fundamental principles of success by encouraging you first to identify
          your values and define the priorities that form the foundation for your goals. You will then learn how to
          articulate your goals such that your dreams can come to life as a series of real action steps that serve as
          the framework for your success plan. Because meeting goals requires taking action, you will then learn about
          and reflect on the motivations and challenges that may drive or impede your progress toward achieving your
          goals. Successfully identifying your motivations and foreseeing how you can adjust your plan in response to
          challenges will help you stay on the road to reach your destination and achieve success.</p>

          Priorities</span></h1>
    </div>


    <div class="section-body">
      <p class="txt">The journey of achieving success in college begins with a single step: identifying your personal
        values. Your personal values are your core beliefs and guiding principles. They shape the roles you play in
        daily life. They color your interests and passions and frame your thoughts and words. In essence, your values
        are a compass that help you make decisions and choices. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Values</h2>


      <p class="txt">Values are the basic beliefs that guide our thinking and actions. Whether we are consciously aware
        of them or not, values influence both our attitudes and our actions. They help us determine what is important
        and what makes us happy. It is important to think about and reflect on your values, especially as you make
        decisions.</p>


      <p class="txt">Another way to recognize the important influence of values is to consider whether you have ever
        made a decision that you later regretted. Did you reflect on your values prior to making that choice? Sometimes
        others ask us to do things that are inconsistent with our values. Knowing what you value and making plans
        accordingly is an important effort to help you stay on track toward your goals.</p>

          <p class="txt">Now recall a decision that you have recently made (for example, a smaller decision about how to
            spend your Saturday or maybe a larger decision about where to apply for part-time work). Did the values you
            identified through this exercise influence that decision? If so, how?</p>

        </div>
      </aside>


      <h2 class="h2">Priorities</h2>


      <p class="txt">Priorities relate to the word &ldquo;prior&rdquo;&mdash;to come first or come before. So
        <strong>priorities</strong> are the things, people, activities, or even beliefs that you give more of your time
        or attention to than other things. Return to the values you selected in the <em>Determining Your Values</em>
        exercise. Of the five values you noted, which is the most important to you? Rank the remaining selected values
        in order of personal importance as well. Is your ranking influenced by your beliefs and philosophies alone? Or
        are there external factors that influence their order of importance, such as a current urgency to attend to a
        loved one, for example?
      </p>

      <a id="p6"></a>

      <p class="txt">While values are intrinsic, arising from our own thinking, they may also conflict with one another.
        Did you take note of that in your own selections and ranking? An example of conflicting values might be valuing
        achievement and education while also valuing selflessness and family. If these values are among your own, how
        would you rank achievement if it means asking your family to sacrifice some time with you? How you choose to
        manage these conflicts reflects your priorities. Your priorities determine where you devote your focus and
        energies at any given time. While your values generally remain static, the hierarchy of their
        importance&mdash;your priorities&mdash;may change over time and are influenced by external factors that may be
        temporary. Priorities, like values, are key to planning because they help define <em>when</em> you will be best
        able to allow your educational goal to take precedence and be ranked as more important than some of your other
        values or obligations, at least for a time. Priorities help you know you&rsquo;re ready to focus on a particular
        value or goal. </p>

    <div class="section-body">

      <p class="txt">Have you ever put together a jigsaw puzzle? Many people start by looking for the edge and corner
        pieces to assemble the border. Some will then group pieces with similar colors, while others just try to fit in
        new pieces as they pick them up. Regardless of strategy, a jigsaw puzzle is most easily solved when people have
        a picture to reference. When you know what the picture should look like, you can gauge your progress and avoid
        making mistakes. If you were to put a puzzle together facedown (cardboard side up, rather than picture side up),
        you could still connect the pieces, but it would take you much longer to understand how it should fit together.
        Your attempts, beyond the border, would be mostly by trial and error. Pursuing anything without goals and a plan
        is like putting together an upside-down puzzle: You can still finish or get to where you&rsquo;re meant to be,
        but it will take you much longer to determine your steps along the way.</p>


      <p class="txt">Goals can be big or small. A goal can range from &ldquo;I am going to write one extra page
        tonight,&rdquo; to &ldquo;I am going to work to get an A in this course,&rdquo; all the way to &ldquo;I am going
        to graduate in the top of my class so I can start my career with a really good position.&rdquo; The great thing
        about goals is that they can include and influence a number of other things that all work toward a much bigger
        picture. For example, if your goal is to get an A in a certain course, all the reading, studying, and every
        assignment you do for that course contributes to the larger goal.</p>


      <p class="txt">Setting goals is frequently talked about, but it is often treated as something abstract. Goal
        setting is best done with careful thought and planning. This section will explain how you can apply tested
        techniques to goal setting and what the benefits of each can be.</p>


      <h2 class="h2">Set Goals That Motivate You</h2>


      <p class="txt">The first thing to know about goal setting is that a goal is a specific end result you desire. If
        the goal is not something you are really interested in, there is little motivational drive to achieve it. Think
        back to when you were much younger and some well-meaning adult set a goal for you&mdash;something that
        didn&rsquo;t really appeal to you at all. How motivated were you to achieve the goal? More than likely, if you
        were successful at all in meeting the goal, it was because you were motivated by earning the approval of someone
        or receiving a possible reward, or you were concerned with avoiding something adverse that might happen if you
        did not do what you were told. From an honest perspective in that situation, your real goal was based on
        something else, not the meeting of the goal set for you. To get the most from the goals you set, make sure they
        are things that you are interested in achieving.</p>

      <a id="p7"></a>

      <p class="txt">That is not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t set goals that are supported by other motivations (e.g., If
        I finish studying by Friday, I can go out on Saturday), but the idea is to be intellectually honest with your
        goals.</p>


      <h2 class="h2">SMART Goals</h2>


      <p class="txt">Goals should also be SMART. A <strong>SMART goal</strong> is one that is not so vague as to be
        meaningless, is concrete enough to be achieved, and is time bound (Day &amp; Tosey, 2011; Locke &amp; Latham,
        2006). In this case, the word &ldquo;SMART&rdquo; is not only a clever description of the type of goal; it is
        also an acronym that stands for &ldquo;specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound.&rdquo; These
        are all desirable traits for your goals because they not only help you plan how to meet the goal, they can also
        contribute to your decision-making processes during the planning stage.</p>


      <p class="txt">What does it mean to create SMART goals?</p>

      <ul class="bl">
        <li class="li_text"><strong>Specific:</strong> For a goal to be specific, it must be defined enough to actually
          determine what is to be achieved, by when, and to what standard. A goal of &ldquo;get a good job when I
          graduate&rdquo; is too general. It doesn&rsquo;t define what a good job is. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t even
          necessarily include a job in your chosen profession. A more specific goal would be something like &ldquo;be
          hired as a nurse in a place of employment where it is enjoyable to work and that has room for
          promotion.&rdquo;</li>

        <li class="li_text"><strong>Measurable:</strong> The concept of <em>measurable</em> is one that is often
          overlooked when setting goals. What this means is that the goal should have clearly defined outcomes that are
          detailed enough to measure and can be used for planning how you will achieve the goal. For example, setting a
          goal of &ldquo;doing well in school&rdquo; is a bit undefined, but making a goal of &ldquo;graduating with a
          GPA above 3.0&rdquo; is measurable and something you can work with. If your goal is measurable, you can know
          ahead of time how many points you will have to earn on a specific assignment to stay in that range or how many
          points you will need to make up in the next assignment if you do not do as well as you planned.</li>

        <li class="li_text"><strong>Achievable:</strong> Achievable goals are ones that are reasonable and within your
          ability to accomplish. While a goal of &ldquo;make an extra $1 million&rdquo; by the end of the week is
          something that would be nice to achieve, the odds that you could make that happen in a single week are not
          very realistic.</li>

        <li class="li_text"><strong>Relevant:</strong> A relevant goal is one that applies to the situation for which
          you are planning. For example, if you are planning for success in college, a goal of buying a new TV is not
          very relevant, but purchasing a new laptop or setting up a space in your home to study would contribute to
          your success in school.</li>

        <li class="li_text"><strong>Time bound:</strong> In order for a goal to be time bound, you must set a specific
          time frame in which to achieve the goal. &ldquo;I will get my paper written by Wednesday&rdquo; is a
          time-bound goal. You know when you have to meet the goal (by Wednesday). &ldquo;I will get my paper written
          sometime soon&rdquo; does not help you plan how and when you will accomplish the goal.</li>

      </ul>

      <a id="p8"></a>

      <p class="txt">In Table 1.1 you can see examples of some basic goals that do and do not follow the SMART system.
        As you read each one, think about what elements make them SMART or how you might change those that are not.</p>

      <p class="txt">SMART goals help you focus on your priorities and manage your time while also providing a means of
        organizing your thinking and actions into manageable steps. Creating long- and short-term goals will help
        connect those action steps.</p>


      <h2 class="h2">Long-Term Goals</h2>


      <p class="txt">Long-term goals are future goals that often take years to complete. An example of a long-term goal
        might be to complete a bachelor of arts degree within 4 years. Another example might be purchasing a home or
        running a marathon. While this chapter focuses on creating a plan for academic success, long-term goals are not
        exclusive to this area of your life. You might set long-term goals related to your career, fitness, wellness,
        spirituality, and relationships, among many others. When you set a long-term goal in any aspect of your life,
        you are demonstrating a commitment to dedicate time and effort toward making progress in that area. Because of
        this commitment, it is important that your long-term goals be aligned with your values.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Short-Term Goals</h2>


      <p class="txt">Short-term goals are typically things you want to accomplish in the near future. Setting short-term
        goals helps you consider the necessary steps you&rsquo;ll need to take, but it also helps chunk a larger effort
        into smaller, more manageable tasks. Even when your long-term goals are SMART, it&rsquo;s easier to stay focused
        and you&rsquo;ll become less overwhelmed in the process of completing short-term goals.</p>

            procedures. In each case, assessment might be structured and formal or highly informal. Although an
            assessment procedure might seem mainly summative, formative, or intended for placement decisions, the
            overriding purpose of educational assessment is to improve student learning.

      <p class="txt">You might assume that short-term and long-term goals are different goals that vary in the length of
        time they take to complete. Given this assumption, you might give the example of a long-term goal of learning
        how to create an app and a short-term goal of remembering to pay your cell phone bill this weekend. These are
        valid goals, but they don&rsquo;t exactly demonstrate the intention of short- and long-term goals for the
        purposes of effective planning.</p>


      <p class="txt">Instead of just being bound by the difference of time, short-term goals are the action steps that
        take less time to complete than a long-term goal but that help you work toward your long-term goals. For
        example, to achieve the long-term goals of determining your best degree option, it might make sense to set the
        short-term goal of researching what kind of career you&rsquo;re most interested in pursuing. Or, if you recall
        that short-term goal of paying your cell phone bill this weekend, perhaps this short-term goal is related to a
        longer term goal of learning how to manage your budgeting and finances better.</p>

    </div>


    <div class="section-body">


      <p class="txt">The purpose of setting goals is to reframe your dreams into more manageable, achievable action
        steps. If you do not take these action steps, however, then your goals will remain dreams. It takes
        determination, passion, and strength of character to persist toward your goals. And, as is the case with longer
        term goals, it often takes help as well. </p>


      <p class="txt">As you set your educational goals and develop a plan of action steps, you&rsquo;ll want to consider
        why you are motivated to pursue these specific goals. How will you draw on this motivation when you encounter
        challenges? While your intentions may be focused on the end goal of achieving a degree, are you also motivated
        and ready to undertake the process of learning? Can you foresee any roadblocks that may stall your progress? How
        will you navigate them? Who will you rely on to help support you and hold you accountable to your intentions if
        your motivation falters? As you plan, anticipate challenges and predict how you will use your strengths and
        resources to overcome them. In doing so, you will be well prepared to achieve your goals. </p>


      <p class="txt">The sections that follow introduce, in further detail, the considerations of motivation, readiness
        to learn, ways to navigate roadblocks, and support systems. Inherent in each of these topics is the idea that
        goals are not met passively. Just as you are learning that planning is a very intentional process, achievement
        is as well. You must take action, and often repeated actions, to achieve your goals. </p>


      <h2 class="h2">Getting and Staying Motivated</h2>


      <p class="txt">Famous physicist Isaac Newton&rsquo;s first law of motion is an often-cited reference in the
        discussion of motivation. It states that, unless acted on by an outside force, an object in motion tends to stay
        in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest. If we apply this same law to motivation, the implication
        is that once you&rsquo;re already moving in a particular direction, it&rsquo;s easier to keep going than it is
        to get started. Getting started often requires some sort of additional push. The beauty of human action is that,
        unlike a physical force on an object, the push to move can come from within us. This push is what we might think
        of as motivation. Motivation may also be thought of as the energy form of our values and priorities.</p>


      <p class="txt">To get motivated, you must set goals that align with your values. This goal-setting process is
        often the first inspirational push toward action. If you can think of the first moments or days after
        you&rsquo;ve set a goal, then perhaps you can relate. You probably feel more focused and more energized to
        pursue the goal right after you&rsquo;ve set it. The greater challenge, and where Newton&rsquo;s metaphor
        sometimes fails us, is to remain in motion and stay motivated&mdash;particularly when pursuing longer term
        goals. To stay motivated you must maintain the same priorities for a period of time, break your goal into
        smaller portions that allow you to celebrate successes along the way to your larger goal, and understand where
        motivation comes from in general so that you can &ldquo;trick&rdquo; yourself into being motivated when
        you&rsquo;re feeling otherwise inert. </p>




      <h3 class="h3">Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation</h3>

      <p class="txt">Psychologists who research motivation suggest that there are two primary sources of motivation:
        intrinsic and extrinsic. <strong>Intrinsic motivation</strong> is driven by internal factors, such as values,
        priorities, and interests. <strong>Extrinsic motivation</strong> is driven by external factors and takes two
        forms: the desire to seek reward or the desire to avoid punishment. </p>

      <a id="p11"></a>
      <p class="txt">To illustrate sources of motivation, consider the example of a child who is very fond of art. The
        child sits for hours cutting, pasting, coloring, and creating. Ask the same child to complete a spelling
        worksheet for homework, and they may refuse to sit still, refuse to focus, and even throw a tantrum. The child
        may finally work through the homework, only after the threat of reduced screen time or after the promise of ice
        cream upon completing the work&mdash;or perhaps both! Why will the child focus on art but refuse to sit in the
        same spot to focus on homework? </p>


      <p class="txt">In this example, the child is intrinsically motivated to do what they enjoy. Intrinsic motivation
        is inspired. It is putting in time and effort for the sake of enjoyment and the sake of the activity itself. The
        child receives pleasure and satisfaction from doing what they like and, therefore, is intrinsically motivated to
        pursue it. While the child is clearly not intrinsically motivated to complete their spelling homework, they may
        become extrinsically motivated to complete it when threatened with punishment or promised a reward. Extrinsic
        motivation is putting in time and effort in order to avoid punishment or receive a reward. In either case,
        extrinsic motivation involves a push from external factors. </p>


      <p class="txt">Adults are similarly motivated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, so you will likely see parallels
        between your own thinking and this illustration. While an idealist may wish that both children and adults were
        intrinsically motivated to learn for the sake of learning, extrinsic motivation plays a vital role in fostering
        competition and in helping you maintain the order of your priorities to see a goal through to completion, even
        if your interests have shifted or changed. </p>


      <p class="txt">You can likely already define what inspires and interests you, or provides you with intrinsic
        motivation. Before moving on in your reading, take a moment to consider the extrinsic motivators that may
        influence you. If you begin to lose your inspiration or enjoyment, you can actually use extrinsic motivators to
        &ldquo;trick&rdquo; your own thinking. You may find that you can persist through writing a college essay with
        the promise of an ice-cream reward as well. </p>


      <h3 class="h3">Readiness to Learn</h3>

      <p class="txt">Because enrolling in a college or university degree program is a big decision&mdash;one of the most
        significant in a lifetime, for many&mdash;it&rsquo;s really important to be able to answer yes to the question
        &ldquo;Am I ready to learn?&rdquo; Researchers have identified various sets of conditions, known as contexts,
        that stimulate learning. In this section we&rsquo;ll cover four particular contexts to help you understand what
        motivates and gives you confidence to learn. As you read about each context, ask yourself, &ldquo;Is this
        context (or set of conditions) similar to mine as I pursue my degree online?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Do I feel
        comfortable thinking of my online learning decision in this context?&rdquo;</p>


      <p class="txt">When you can answer yes to these questions, you are acquiring a level of self-knowledge and
        confidence about what motivates you to proceed toward your goal of a college or university degree. That is, you
        are not saying &ldquo;I should&rdquo; get a university degree or &ldquo;I want&rdquo; to get a degree. Instead,
        you are recognizing (and saying) &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m ready to begin . . . I feel comfortable identifying
        myself with a particular supportive context or perspective&mdash;one that motivates me to learn and makes my
        goal realistic and highly desirable.&rdquo;</p>

      <a id="p12"></a>
      <p class="txt">As you review the following &ldquo;readiness to learn contexts,&rdquo; you may find particular
        aspects that describe your situation in more than one context, and you may not feel that you completely fit into
        any one of the four. That&rsquo;s fine. Human decisions are normally motivated by more than one source. But you
        should determine which of these contexts for learning supports you in a primary way and which supports you in a
        secondary way.</p>


      <h3 class="h3">Contexts That Motivate Learning</h3>

      <p class="txt">Based on the research of Malcolm Knowles (1984), the following are four &ldquo;distinct
        contexts&rdquo; that stimulate adults to learn. We have cited a student experience to illustrate each one. Read
        each short narrative carefully and think about your own situation as you proceed.</p>


      <p class="txt"><strong>Practical Context</strong></p>


      <p class="txt">I need to know in order to cope with things I face.</p>


      <p class="txt">Sara&rsquo;s story: I&rsquo;m pretty open to learning, but I&rsquo;m most enthusiastic about it
        when I know that I&rsquo;m going to gain something practical from it. I&rsquo;m not really interested in just
        being told, &ldquo;You gotta learn this,&rdquo; without knowing in advance how it&rsquo;s going to benefit me.
        That doesn&rsquo;t mean I always have to apply what I learn immediately. I&rsquo;m comfortable with knowing it
        will be useful sometime in the future. When I think about situations in my family and at work that make demands
        on me, I feel that I&rsquo;m handling them, but I&rsquo;d like to be able to cope with them better. I&rsquo;d
        like to be sure about the approaches I&rsquo;m taking and decisions I&rsquo;m making. I&rsquo;d like solutions
        to problems I face.</p>


      <p class="txt"><strong>Personal Context</strong></p>


      <p class="txt">I want to do this myself and accomplish important goals.</p>


      <p class="txt">Chris&rsquo;s story: When it comes to learning, I see myself positioned in the starting blocks with
        a clear path stretched out in front of me, a path that will get me to the finish line. Sure, it would be a bit
        foolish to say, &ldquo;I see the finish line clearly,&rdquo; because I&rsquo;m realistic enough to know that
        circumstances, conflicts, and surprises always happen to slow you down. But what motivates me to learn is being
        able to say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a goal out there that I can glimpse, and I&rsquo;m committed to reaching
        it.&rdquo; I know what it is, and I&rsquo;m on my way toward getting there. Learning makes me feel better about
        myself, and I definitely think that the learning quest that I&rsquo;m on will improve the quality of my life and
        my future.</p>


      <p class="txt"><strong>Experiential Context</strong></p>


      <p class="txt">I&rsquo;m at a point that I can pull things together from experience.</p>


      <p class="txt">Fred&rsquo;s story: A lot of people talk primarily about the future when they explain their
        interest in learning. I realize that it&rsquo;s important to plan for the future. But I like to consider the
        past, too, and my significant insights from past experiences. Real-life experiences have informed me accurately
        about many things, allowing me to develop a solid foundation for forming values and being confident in what I do
        and think. I may have to unlearn some things, but I&rsquo;m open to that. My ideal learning environment is one
        in which I can consider what I&rsquo;ve already learned from life experience, reflect on it, and then adapt it
        to a new situation&mdash;discovering new meaning and competence in the process.</p>


      <a id="p13"></a>
      <p class="txt"><strong>Idealistic Context</strong></p>


      <p class="txt">I want to explore ideas, theories, and concepts to experience discovery of something new.</p>


      <p class="txt">Jamie&rsquo;s story: Researchers call me a cognitive learner. Those who don&rsquo;t use such
        technical terms label me as a person more interested in theory than in practice. I can accept that, but I know
        that practice can&rsquo;t be avoided entirely. In any given situation, what triggers my interest in learning is
        learning for its own sake. I know grades, diplomas, and new jobs are desirable aspects of the formal educational
        journey, but they don&rsquo;t motivate me nearly as much as the pleasure of discovering something new or
        learning something that may not have utilitarian value. For me, there&rsquo;s joy just in expanding my mind, and
        I don&rsquo;t plan to abandon this learning process as long as I live.</p>

      <p class="txt">Individual approaches to learning are changed by circumstances and age. So in returning to college,
        it&rsquo;s important to (a) be aware of the particular contexts and circumstances that motivate you and (b)
        evaluate what truly motivates you to seek your educational goal. This serious, honest exploration is a sure
        means of determining whether you are ready for the learning journey ahead, including a plan to &ldquo;fit
        school&rdquo; into your day-to-day life. When you are motivated toward your goal by a particularly strong
        context or have a strong personal drive toward achieving it, you are well on your way to being ready to embrace
        learning! </p>

          <p class="caption">It is common to encounter roadblocks on the way to achieving your goals. Being able to
            overcome negative thinking, expect and manage change, and ask for help are key to navigating your way around
            them.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>



      <p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re a generally punctual person. You&rsquo;ve made an arrangement to
        meet a friend in the next town for a cup of coffee. You&rsquo;ve been to the coffee shop before, so you know the
        route and how long it will take to get there. You leave on time, but there&rsquo;s unexpected construction
        traffic along the way that causes a delay. You arrive 20 minutes late, and your friend has already finished the
        coffee they ordered when they arrived on time. Because you are allergic to dairy, you order a soy latte, only to
        find out that the coffee shop is out of soy. When you finally settle on a cup of tea, you realize you&rsquo;ve
        forgotten your wallet. Thankfully, your friend grabs this one for you and says you&rsquo;ll owe them next time.
        You sit and chat, and you begin to calm down from this series of frustrations.</p>



      <p class="txt">Perhaps you&rsquo;ve encountered some of these exact frustrations in your own life. Each
        frustration in this illustration is minor, of course, but they serve as a good reminder that even when we have
        the skills, plan, motivation, and best of intentions, roadblocks (like construction traffic) can derail and
        disappoint. This simple illustration also provides an example of the skills you need to navigate and overcome
        roadblocks. Continuing to press on through the traffic and continue toward your goal despite the delay
        demonstrates the mindset to overcome negative thinking. Selecting a tea when soy isn&rsquo;t available
        demonstrates the ability to manage change. Making a payment arrangement with your friend and enjoying the
        calming effect of their company demonstrates the ability to ask for help and build and rely on your support
        systems. </p>


      <p class="txt">The next sections clarify these concepts as they relate to roadblocks you may encounter as you work
        toward your planned goal, but as you read further, it is important to keep in mind that you already have what it
        takes to navigate and overcome problems even when facing higher stakes goals than a coffee date.</p>


      <h3 class="h3">Combating Negative Bias and Stereotype Threat</h3>

      <p class="txt">Negative bias and stereotype threat are two psychological tendencies that can not only adversely
        affect learning but can set up roadblocks that may prevent you from achieving many goals. </p>


      <p class="txt"><strong>Negative bias</strong> is the psychological trait of focusing on the negative aspects of a
        situation rather than the positive. An example of this in a learning environment would be earning a 95% score on
        an assignment but obsessing over the 5% of the points that were missed. Another example would be worrying and
        thinking negative thoughts about yourself over a handful of courses in which you did not do as well as in
        others&mdash;so much so that you begin to doubt your abilities altogether.</p>


      <p class="txt">Unfortunately, this is a human tendency that can often overwhelm a student. As a pure survival
        mechanism, it does have its usefulness in that it reminds us to be wary of behaviors that can result in
        undesirable outcomes. Imagine that as a child playing outside, you have seen dozens if not hundreds of bees over
        the years. But once, out of all those other times, you were stung by a single bee. Now every time you see a bee
        you recall the sting, and you now have a negative bias toward bees in general. Whenever possible, you avoid bees
        altogether.</p>

      <a id="p15"></a>

      <p class="txt">It is easy to see how this psychological system could be beneficial in those types of situations,
        but it can be a hindrance in learning since a large part of the learning process often involves failure on early
        attempts. Recognizing this is a key to overcoming negative bias. Another way to combat negative bias is to
        purposefully focus on successes and to acknowledge earlier attempts that fail as just a part of the learning
        process.</p>


      <p class="txt">What follows are a few methods for overcoming negative bias and negative self-talk. Each focuses on
        being aware of any negative attitude or emphasizing the positive aspects in a situation.</p>


      <ul class="bl">
        <li class="li_text"><strong>Be aware of any negative bias.</strong> Keep an eye out for any time you find
          yourself focusing on some negative aspect, whether regarding your own abilities or a specific situation.
          Whenever you recognize that you are exhibiting a negative bias toward something, stop and look for the
          positive parts of the experience. Remind yourself that any lack of success is only temporary, and focus on
          what you have learned that gets you closer to your goal.</li>
        <li class="li_text"><strong>Focus on the positive before you begin.</strong> While reversing the impact of
          negative bias on your learning is helpful, it can be even more useful to prevent it in the first place. One
          way to do this is to look for the positives before you begin a task. An example of this would be receiving
          early feedback for an assignment you are working on. To accomplish this, you can often ask your instructor or
          one of your classmates to look over your work and provide some informal comments. If the feedback is positive,
          then you know you are on the right track. That is useful information. Feedback that indicates you need to make
          a number of corrections and adjustments is even more useful; you can use it to improve the assignment for a
          better final grade. In either case accurate feedback is what you really want most, and both outcomes are
          positive for you.</li>
        <li class="li_text"><strong>Keep a gratitude and accomplishment journal.</strong> Again, the tendency to recall
          and overemphasize the negative instances while ignoring or forgetting about the positive outcomes is the
          nature of negative bias. Sometimes we need a little help remembering the positives, and we can prompt our
          memories by keeping a journal. Just as in a diary, the idea is to keep a flowing record of the positive things
          that happen, the lessons you learned from instances that were &ldquo;less than successful,&rdquo; and all
          accomplishments you make toward learning. In your journal you can write or paste anything that you appreciated
          or that has positive outcomes. Whenever you are not feeling up to a challenge or when negative bias is
          starting to wear on you, you can look over your journal to remind yourself of previous accomplishments in the
          face of adversity.</li>
      </ul>


      <p class="txt">Like negative bias, stereotype threat is a similar psychological phenomenon that can impact your
        performance and ability to achieve your goals. Essentially, <strong>stereotype threat</strong> occurs when a
        member of a social group feels at risk of conforming to stereotypes about that group. Stereotypes are the
        assumptions about different groups (such as different ethnic, racial, or cultural groups) that characterize that
        group as a whole, rather than accounting for individual differences. Research on stereotypes indicates that a
        widespread belief about a group&rsquo;s ability to perform well on a task can negatively impact the performance
        of an individual who identifies as a member of that group (Steele &amp; Aronson, 1995; Aronson et al., 2002).
        Whereas negative bias may arise from your own habits or ways of thinking, stereotype threat demonstrates the
        possible impact of others&rsquo; thinking or beliefs on your performance. Stereotype threat can result in stress
        and anxiety that actually do negatively impact performance, as well as increased pressure to prove the
        stereotype wrong. </p>


      <p class="txt">The first step to combat stereotype threat is to be aware of this phenomenon. To avoid having
        others&rsquo; expectations become self-fulfilling, it is important to recognize your strengths and skills as an
        individual and question when group labels are applied when related to academic performance. Following role
        models who have overcome stereotype threat can also serve as a source of inspiration that can keep you focused
        on possibilities for your own future as well. </p>

      <h3 class="h3">Expecting and Managing Change</h3>

      <p class="txt">After you&rsquo;ve devoted time to planning, it can be frustrating when circumstances unexpectedly
        change. Change can be the result of internal or external factors. Internal factors are those that you have
        control over. They may include indecision, changing your mind about a situation after receiving new information,
        or recognizing that something is not a good fit for your values and goals. Though change resulting from internal
        factors can be stressful, it is often easier to accept and to navigate because you know why the change must
        occur. You can plan for a change and make even better decisions for your path when the reason for change is
        something over which you have control! </p>


      <p class="txt">External factors that necessitate change are often harder to plan for and accept. Some external
        factors may include financial concerns, your health or the health of a loved one, or other family circumstances.
        Change caused by external factors can be frustrating. Because external factors are often unexpected, when you
        encounter them you&rsquo;ll often have to spend more time changing your plans or even revising your goals before
        you&rsquo;ll feel as though you&rsquo;re back on track.</p>


      <p class="txt">It is important to recognize that change, whether internal or external, is inevitable. You can
        probably think of an example of a time when you had to change your plans due to unforeseen circumstances.
        Perhaps it&rsquo;s a situation as simple as canceling a date with friends because of an obligation to babysit a
        sibling. Even though this simple example would not have had long-term consequences, you can probably recall a
        feeling of disappointment. It&rsquo;s okay to feel disappointed; however, you&rsquo;ll also want to recognize
        that you can manage your response to changing circumstances. You can ask yourself the following questions:</p>


      <ul class="bl">
        <li class="li_text">What can I control in this situation?</li>
        <li class="li_text">Do I need to reconsider my values?</li>
        <li class="li_text">Do I need to reconsider my goals?</li>
        <li class="li_text">Do I need to change my plans as a result of this new information or these new circumstances?
        </li>
        <li class="li_text">What resources, tools, or people are available to assist me in revising my plans?</li>
      </ul>


      <p class="txt">When encountering change, it helps to remember that decision-making and planning are continuous
        processes. In other words, active individuals are always engaged in decision-making, setting new plans, and
        revising old plans. This continuous process is not always the result of major life-changing circumstances,
        either. Oftentimes, we need to make changes simply because we&rsquo;ve learned some new information that causes
        a shift in our plans. Planning, like learning, is an ongoing lifetime process.</p>

      <a id="p17"></a>

      <h3 class="h3">Asking for Help</h3>

      <p class="txt">There are a number of individuals who can help you plan your path, but keep in mind that your path
        is ultimately your own. Some students make the mistake of taking too much advice when planning and making
        decisions. They may forgo their values and goals for others&rsquo; values and goals for them. Or they may
        mistakenly trust advice that comes from well-meaning but ill-informed sources.</p>


      <p class="txt">In other cases, students may grapple with unfamiliar college paperwork and technology with little
        assistance. It&rsquo;s important to know that seeking help is a strength, not a weakness, particularly when that
        help comes from well-informed individuals who have your best interests in mind. When you share your goals and
        include others in your planning, you develop both a support network and a system of personal accountability.
        Being held accountable for your goals means that others are also tracking your progress and are interested in
        seeing you succeed. When you are working toward a goal and sticking to a plan, it&rsquo;s important to have
        unconditional cheerleaders in your life as well as folks who keep pushing you to stay on track, especially if
        they see you stray. It&rsquo;s important to know who in your life can play these roles.</p>


      <h2 class="h2">Support Systems for Learning Success</h2>


      <p class="txt">Have you ever heard the saying &ldquo;It takes a village. . .&rdquo;? That proverb is applicable to
        college students as well. There will indeed be times when you may feel overwhelmed, frustrated, isolated, or
        simply just tired as you complete your program of study. That is where a strong support network will come in.
        Your personal support network could consist of your family, friends, coworkers, and community. Their support,
        understanding, and continual motivation is good, of course, but they may also provide you more direct assistance
        as well. Letting these special people in your life know specifically what you need and how they can help you be
        successful in college is definitely a conversation to have early and often.</p>


      <h3 class="h3">Support From Family and Friends</h3>

      <p class="txt">Because of the duration of our relationships, the amount of time we spend to together, and our
        emotional closeness, family and friends tend to be our greatest influences. This influence can be negative and
        can serve as a strong motivator for an individual to strive for something different from the examples set by
        peers and family. Or, and as is hopefully the case for your experience, this influence can serve as a strong
        positive foundation for your support network. Or perhaps, as you reflect on your own circle, it is a mix of
        these influences. In any case it is important to identify family and friends who support your goals. </p>


      <p class="txt">Family and friends know you. They are familiar with your strengths and weaknesses. They have
        witnessed what triggers your stress, how you respond to stress, and how you cope. Because they have this
        knowledge, if family and friends are open to sharing, they can often help you become more self-aware, make
        better decisions about how and where to channel your efforts, and better manage work&ndash;life balance and
        stress. Conversely, you also know your family and friends. You know who you can contact to answer your
        questions, talk through your thinking about an assignment, or provide words of encouragement. You know who will
        call you out when you&rsquo;re procrastinating. You know who will be understanding of your need to make fewer
        social plans or to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; in a quiet space to study for a while. You also know who will distract you
        and get you off track, even if they have good intentions or have immediate needs that they need you to fulfill
        (such as with a child or an elder in your care). </p>

      <a id="p18"></a>

      <p class="txt">Consider these individuals in your immediate circle as you set your goals. Open early lines of
        communication with family and friends who will understand and help give you space and support, but also open
        early lines of communication with family and friends who might not yet understand. Share what you need from
        these individuals so that you can succeed. If you are able to, set specific expectations, particularly with
        those for whom you provide care, about how often you can respond to needs. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll be an
        inspirational support for them as well! </p>


      <h3 class="h3">Support From Faculty</h3>

      <p class="txt">Solid student&ndash;faculty relationships can be foundational to a successful college experience.
        College students are sometimes surprised to discover that instructors enjoy getting to know students. The human
        dimension of college really matters, and as a student you are an important part of your instructor&rsquo;s
        world. Most instructors are happy to work with you via digital messages, phone, or online discussion forums.
      </p>


      <p class="txt">One of the many benefits of communicating with instructors is that it can help you feel more
        comfortable in college and more connected to the college culture. Research has indicated that students who are
        connected and feel as though they are a part of the college community are less likely to become dispirited and
        drop out (Tinto, 2012). In an online learning environment, communication with instructors (and classmates, of
        course!) is one of the best ways to develop this connection. </p>


      <p class="txt">Communicating with instructors is also a valuable way to learn about an academic field or a career.
        Maybe you don&rsquo;t know for sure what you want to major in or what people with a degree in your chosen major
        actually do after college. Most instructors will share information and insights with you.</p>


      <p class="txt">Think about what being &ldquo;educated&rdquo; truly means: how one thinks, understands society and
        the world, and responds to problems and new situations. Much of this learning occurs outside of the formal
        class. Communicating with your instructors and college leaders can be among your most meaningful experiences in
        college.</p>



      <aside class="aside color-2">
        <h4 class="aside_title">Communication Skills: Interacting With Faculty</h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
          <p class="txt">College students enter into a world surrounded by people who are very invested in student
            success. Faculty are students&rsquo; greatest champions and look for ways to help them learn and prosper.
            Just think&mdash;faculty loved college so much they came back . . . or never left. They have years of
            experience navigating the college scene and can provide you with a wealth of information when you run up
            against a barrier. Knowing that should give you some comfort&mdash;you have an amazing team in your corner
            to help you move toward your goals. Sometimes students don&rsquo;t want to impose on faculty members or
            bother them with questions or concerns. Actually, faculty welcome questions and want students to ask for
            clarification if they are confused about an assignment or subject-related question. </p>
          <p class="txt">Getting along with instructors and communicating well begins with attitude. As experts in their
            field, instructors deserve respect. Remember that a college education is a collaborative process that works
            best when students and instructors communicate freely in an exchange of ideas, information, and
            perspectives. So while you should respect your instructors, there is no need to fear them. As you get to
            know them better, you&rsquo;ll learn their personalities and find appropriate ways to talk to them. Below
            are some guidelines for getting along with and communicating with your instructors:</p>
          <a id="p19"></a>

          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="txt"><strong>Prepare before talking with the instructor.</strong> Go over your notes on readings
                and assignments and write down your specific questions. You&rsquo;ll feel more comfortable, and the
                instructor will appreciate you being organized.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="txt"><strong>Respect the instructor&rsquo;s time.</strong> In addition to teaching, college
                instructors participate in committees, conduct research and other professional work, and have personal
                lives. It&rsquo;s not appropriate to arrive late to a scheduled appointment and expect the instructor to
                stay late to talk with you.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="txt"><strong>Don&rsquo;t try to fool an instructor.</strong> Insincere praise or making excuses
                for not doing an assignment will rarely play in your favor (they&rsquo;ve heard it all before!). Nor is
                it a good idea to act like you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too cool&rdquo; to take your classwork
                seriously&mdash;another attitude that&rsquo;s sure to put off an instructor. To earn your
                instructor&rsquo;s respect, do the work, genuinely participate in class discussions, and show
                respect&mdash;and the instructor will be happy to work with you should you need some extra help.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="txt"><strong>Be professional when talking to an instructor.</strong> You can be cordial and
                friendly, but it&rsquo;s ideal to keep it professional and on an adult level. Unless the instructor has
                already asked you to address them as &ldquo;Dr. _______,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ms. _______,&rdquo; or Mr.
                _______,&rdquo; or something similar, it&rsquo;s appropriate to say &ldquo;Professor _______.&rdquo; Use
                this individualized access to your professors wisely and ask genuine questions that help you clarify
                points you didn&rsquo;t understand from your readings, assignments, or discussions. Be prepared to
                accept constructive criticism in a professional way, without taking it personally or complaining.</p>

              <p class="txt"><strong>If you need more help, go back again and discuss the issue with your

      <h3 class="h3">Support From Work Relationships</h3>

      <p class="txt">Maintaining a structure of open communication and compromise can be useful in developing awareness
        of your educational goals in your work relationships and in identifying support. Often, you can arrange
        adjustments in such areas as scheduling and team responsibility assignments if you engage your colleagues and
        supervisors in open communication about the workload and timelines you are facing in your university courses.
        The common understanding resulting from such conversations creates a basis for maintaining work productivity and
        replacing frustration with support. </p>


      <p class="txt">In addition to aiding in prioritizing your time and workload, work relationships can also provide
        you support specific to the content and skills that you&rsquo;re learning in your courses. Your workplace has
        likely provided you with life experiences and opportunities to learn specific technical skills that provide the
        foundation for new learning. Having prior knowledge about a related subject can help you learn and remember new
        information. Making connections and practicing what you&rsquo;re learning helps reinforce that learning. For
        example, coursework that involves computer skills, hones teamwork and leadership skills, improves public
        speaking, and develops your professional communication skills may directly or indirectly relate to your current
        work. The ability to practice these skills both in coursework and at work provides you an advantage. </p>

      <a id="p20"></a>

      <p class="txt">Sharing what you&rsquo;re learning with trusted colleagues also provides opportunity to practice
        and apply new knowledge. It may also provide the added benefit of helping employers know (if they&rsquo;re not
        already aware) that you&rsquo;re a goal-directed and motivated individual. Recognition of your potential and the
        skills that you&rsquo;re learning may provide you further opportunities for future projects or promotions. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>

      <p class="txt">This chapter began by describing the guideposts for planning: values, priorities, and goals. These
        guideposts are interrelated and deeply individual, since they stem from your core beliefs, philosophies, and
        inspirations. While your goals may differ from others&rsquo;, there are universal best practices for setting
        goals. Recall that a goal remains a dream unless you actually take the steps to achieve it. The primary purpose
        of articulating SMART goals and developing short-term milestones toward your longer term goal is to make that
        goal more manageable and to help you become and stay motivated as you see your progress. </p>


      <p class="txt">Keep in mind that as you track this progress, you may need to make changes to your plan. You may
        need to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; yourself with rewards or engage in friendly competition with study partners, relying
        on extrinsic motivators to reignite your motivation. You can refer back to the section on managing change to
        consider how you might respond if you face such challenges. Finally, recall that others can both help you plan
        and hold you accountable to your goals, but only you define your values, so feel confident in sticking to them!
      </p>
