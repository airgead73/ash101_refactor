          results were a disaster. They greatly chagrined his mother—especially when, following a series of countywide

        <p class="intro__tx">"Jacob should probably stop dreaming about going to university and becoming a professor,"

        <h3 class="focus__text">What is this Chapter about?</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="so__intro">Determining the best assessment procedures and instruments is no simple matter and is thus
        not without controversy. Although educators and parents do not always agree on these matters, there is general
        consensus about the characteristics of good measuring instruments.</p>
    </div>

    <section class="section">
      <p class="keypoint">Most important is that evaluative instruments be fair and that students see them as being
        fair.</p>

      <p class="tx">The most common student complaint about tests and testing practices has to do with their imagined
        or real lack of fairness (Bouville, 2008; Takayama, 2018). The importance of test fairness was highlighted
        during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. President John F. Kennedy's decision to send troops to Vietnam led large
        numbers of age-eligible men to be drafted as soldiers, some of whom died or were seriously injured in the war.
        Men who went to college were usually exempt from the draft—or their required military service was at least
        deferred. So, to avoid being drafted, it became crucial for many young men to be admitted to undergraduate or
        postgraduate studies. For some, passing college or graduate entrance exams was literally a matter of life and
        death. Therefore, it was vital that the admission exams be as fair as possible.</p>

      <p class="tx">Just how fair are our educational assessments? We don't always know. Yet science provides ways to
        define and sometimes actually measure the characteristics of tests.</p>

      <p class="tx">For example, the best assessment instruments have three important qualities:</p>

      <ol class="ol">
        <li>fairness</li>
        <li>validity</li>
        <li>reliability</li>
      </ol>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>
      <p class="keypoint">Assessment that is mainly used to provide a midterm or year-end grade, or to assess mastery at
        the end of a unit, is called <span class="keyterm">summative assessment</span>.</p>
      <p class="tx">Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly because
        its historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of future
        success. Selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as Stiggins and Chappuis (2017)
        explain.</p>
      <p class="keypoint">Schools increasingly need to ensure that learners know how to learn—that they become
        competent, self-directed learners who are actively involved in their own education.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>

      <p class="tx">Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is called <span
          class="keyterm">formative assessment</span>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess
        and assist learner progress and comprehension during a lesson, course, or unit.</p>

      <p class="keypoint">Put another way, formative assessment is assessment for learning; summative assessment is
        assessment of learning.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>

      <p class="tx">Formative assessment is that which is embedded in the teaching–learning process. Much of it is
        informal rather than structured and formal. It has the following features:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li>It consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student performances and
          products.</li>
        <li>It involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching and learning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="keypoint">Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or grade (summative assessment), formative
        assessment provides information that a teacher and learner can put to use before formal grading occurs.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>

      <p class="tx">As Hattie (2012) puts it, "The primary function of assessment is to support learning by generating
        feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there, and where they
        might go next" (p. 126).</p>

      <p class="keypoint">Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is (or should be) formative.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
      <p class="keypoint">As the name implies, <span class="keyterm">placement assessment</span> is designed to provide
        information relating to a learner's placement.</p>

      <p class="tx">It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence and looks at the learner's readiness for a
        lesson, unit, course, or entire program.</p>

      <p class="tx">Placement assessment often includes diagnostic assessment, which is directed specifically at
        identifying learning strengths or problems and their underlying causes. For example, diagnostic assessment might
        be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from being placed in a group that receives remedial
        instruction in reading or mathematics.</p>

      <p class="tx">Of course, the fact that both learners and educational emphases are changing does not mean that all
        teachers stress the formative role of assessment over its summative uses. Some critics point out that many of
        today's schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of the past. Groshell (2017), for example, notes that
        although there have been enormous advances in both technology and educational goals, relatively little has
        changed regarding how schools view learning and how they design the learning environment. Still, there is little
        doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are changing—and even less doubt that they should.

          <p class="fig__text">The planning-teaching-assessing cycle is just that—a cycle. Events are continuous and
            overlapping. Assessing and planning occur during instruction, before instruction, and after instruction. In
            addition, it is a collaborative effort: Learners are closely involved in the entire cycle.</p>

        constantly overlap.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Test</h3>

    <p class="keypoint">In education, the word test typically refers to specific instruments or procedures designed to
      measure student achievement or progress, or to identify various student characteristics.</p>

    <p class="tx">Tests typically consist of a sample of behaviors (responses) that serve as a basis for making
      inferences. For example, a ninth-grade algebra final test does not examine students' complete body of algebraic
      knowledge or their ability to solve all problems related to the entire course. Instead, the test consists of a
      representative sample of problems. If a student responds correctly to 84% of the problems, the examiner infers
      that the student also would have responded correctly to 84% of the entire pool of relevant problems.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Priorities</h2>
      <p class="tx">Priorities relate to the word “prior”—to come first or come before. So <span
          class="keyterm">priorities</span> are the things, people, activities, or even beliefs that you give more of
        your time or attention to than other things. Return to the values you selected in the Determining Your Values
        exercise. Of the five values you noted, which is the most important to you? Rank the remaining selected values
        in order of personal importance as well. Is your ranking influenced by your beliefs and philosophies alone? Or
        are there external factors that influence their order of importance, such as a current urgency to attend to a
        loved one, for example?</p>

          <p class="fig__text">Another effective way to brainstorm topic ideas is to use a dictation app on your
            smartphone to take notes. You can talk freely about your thoughts while the phone documents your ideas.</p>

      <p class="tx">While values are intrinsic, arising from our own thinking, they may also conflict with one another.
        Did you take note of that in your own selections and ranking? An example of conflicting values might be valuing
        achievement and education while also valuing selflessness and family. If these values are among your own, how
        would you rank achievement if it means asking your family to sacrifice some time with you? How you choose to
        manage these conflicts reflects your priorities. Your priorities determine where you devote your focus and
        energies at any given time. While your values generally remain static, the hierarchy of their importance—your
        priorities—may change over time and are influenced by external factors that may be temporary. Priorities, like
        values, are key to planning because they help define when you will be best able to allow your educational goal
        to take precedence and be ranked as more important than some of your other values or obligations, at least for a
        time. Priorities help you know you’re ready to focus on a particular value or goal.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Reading Systems</h2>

      <p class="tx">Active reading takes time and cannot be rushed. College students employ a number of reading
        systems, or specific methods of approaching reading, to help them make the most of the time they spend actively
        reading. This section covers only a portion of those systems, but no matter what system you adopt, devote time,
        attention, and effort to the process for the most effective results.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">SQ3R</h3>
      <p class="tx">One of the most popular systems for active reading is known as SQ3R, which is short for “survey,
        question, read, recite, and review” the steps in the system. This system is simple to follow and can
        significantly improve your understanding of what you read.</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li>
          <p class="li__tx"><strong>Survey:</strong> To survey means to preview information. Before reading a chapter,
            skim or flip through it and read the bold headings that divide the text into different sections. These
            headings show you how the chapter is organized and express the main ideas it will cover. As you survey the
            chapter, pay attention to any hints, tips, or other material shown in the margins or provided in hyperlinks.
            This text is specially formatted to make it stand out from the rest of the text; it usually summarizes major
            points or provides helpful information. Next, examine all graphs, pictures, diagrams, and tables. These
            serve to summarize information in a clear and concise way. Finally, read the introductory and summary
            paragraphs at the beginning and end of the chapter. These paragraphs indicate what to look for in the
            chapter and recap the most important information.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="li__tx"><strong>Question:</strong> After your survey, go back to the beginning of the chapter and
            start reading the headings. As you come to each chapter heading or subheading, change it to a question that
            features the words “who,” “what,” “where,” “when,” “why,” or “how.” For example, this chapter’s title is
            “Reading Strategies.” If we change this heading to a question, it might read, “What are reading strategies?”
            As you read, you will look for information in the chapter that answers that question. Looking for answers to
            such questions is a form of engaging with the text, and doing so helps you create your own dialogue with it.
            There is no right or wrong way to form one of these questions. Just apply this method to each chapter
            heading and subheading as you come across it. Challenging yourself in this way will help you stay interested
            in what you are reading and improve your understanding of the text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="li__tx"><strong>Read:</strong>Use the questions you created during the question stage to begin
            reading actively. Think about what the text means. Because you are reading for information that you may need
            to retrieve later— for either an exam or a written assignment—develop a system for recording information as
            you read it. Underline or highlight information that answers your question or that you think is important.
            Or you can use an asterisk (*), an exclamation point (!), or a question mark (?) to mark passages you think
            are particularly important to remember.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="li__tx"><strong>Recite:</strong> After you have finished reading a section of text, test whether
            you actually understand the material by trying to restate it. Reciting does not necessarily mean you say
            anything out loud. You can recite what you learned to yourself, silently. Or you might tell someone else
            what you learned, discuss it in a written post, or write a short paragraph in a notebook that summarizes the
            information. However you choose to “recite,” it is important that you recap what you learned in some way.
            Think of reciting as a type of self-test to reinforce material in your mind. If you do not clearly
            understand what you read, go back and review it again. Or ask your instructor or other students to help
            clarify the meaning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="li__tx"><strong>Review:</strong> Finally, review the most important information by going back and
            looking over what you underlined, marked, or highlighted. Reread or type up your handwritten notes. Imagine
            the sort of quiz questions you might be asked on the material and make sure you have answers to them. When
            you are finished reading the assigned text, summarize the main points or ideas you think the text is
            suggesting. Your ultimate goal is to gain a sense of what is valuable in the text.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Evaluating Sources of Information</h2>
      <p class="tx">The explosive growth and use of the Internet in the 21st century has had a profound effect on how
        people access, interpret, and use information. People turn to the Internet to help them find information for
        everything from the location of restaurants, to instructions on starting their own business, to possible reasons
        for that curious rash on their big toe. In addition, of course, students turn to the Internet to find resources
        for their academic papers (Head, 2013).</p>
