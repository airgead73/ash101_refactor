      <p class="tx">Guy Lefran&#231;ois was born in the wilds of Northern Canada, where he learned many things that he
        thought would eventually show up on a test. They haven&#39;t yet. Most of the tests he has faced have posed
        different problems. Tough ones. &quot;Your head is filled with useless stuff,&quot; his grandmother declared.
        &quot;You&#39;d better go to university.&quot; So he did, and he stayed long enough to become a professor at the
        University of Alberta, where he currently holds an appointment. Academia filled his head with things that people
        do put on tests&#8212;stuff that he cleverly turned into dozens of different textbooks that have since been
        translated into various languages, most of which are Greek to him. He has been happily married to Marie since he
        left that northern wilderness. They have three children (Laurier, Claire, and R&#233;mi) and five grandchildren
        (Elizabeth, Liam, Zachary, Nathan, and Michael), amazing people. He loves to go on extended bicycle tours, fish,
        sit on tree stumps, watch birds and butterflies, and learn new stuff that just might be on the test.</p>

    <h1 id="preface" class="h1_fm">Preface to the Second Edition</h1>
    <p class="tx">As the first edition of this book explained, to the consternation of one of the book&#39;s
      reviewers&#8212; identified only as R6&#8212;Oog and Ugh, two of our cave-dwelling ancestors, had no clock, no
      ruler, and no yardstick. &quot;That&#39;s ridiculous,&quot; wrote said reviewer. The thought had not occurred to
      me. It <em>is</em> ridiculous. But it&#39;s very close to an important truth.</p>

    <p class="tx">&quot;How far?&quot; Ugh would ask.</p>

    <p class="tx">&quot;Pretty far,&quot; Oog would answer.</p>

    <p class="tx">&quot;When?&quot; Oog would ask.</p>

    <p class="tx">&quot;By and by,&quot; Ugh would reply. None of these answers was very convenient.</p>

    <p class="tx">Then along came the Greeks who, among other things, invented the foot measure. They measured
      Hercules&#39;s foot, says the legend, and that became the length of the foot ruler. One twelfth of a foot became
      an inch, which in many languages is a &quot;thumb&quot;&#8212;(<em>pouce</em> in French; <em>pulgada</em> in
      Spanish). It is likely that the expression &quot;rule of thumb&quot; originates from the use of the width of the
      thumb as a rough measure of an inch.</p>

    <p class="tx">But some people we know have tiny feet and small hands; others have extra-long limbs with fingers and
      toes of outrageous length and thumbs wide as spades. This makes for inconsistent and confusing measurements, which
      the French didn&#39;t much like.</p>

    <p class="tx">It&#39;s a long story that cannot be retold here. Suffice it to say that a Frenchman said one day,
      Hey, we need a universal system of weights and measures&#8212;<em>un syst&#232;me internationale (SI)</em>, as he
      put it&#8212;which the French then proceeded to invent and which, to this day, is called the SI system. It&#39;s
      the <em>metric</em> system: It uses the meter as a basis for measuring length and distance.</p>

    <p class="tx">But in the beginning, meter was just a concept: It had no precise length. How long should a meter be?
      Someone thought it would be a good idea to make it 1/10,000,000 of the distance between the equator and the North
      Pole.</p>

    <p class="tx">It wasn&#39;t an easy distance to measure, but a pair of Frenchman tried, and their measurements were
      remarkably close, although not entirely exact. Now we measure the length of a meter using the speed of light. A
      meter is the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second!</p>

    <p class="tx">Science depends on accurate systems to measure weight, distance, speed, time, volume.... If we want to
      go to Mars, we need to know exactly how far it is and how fast we are going. If we mistakenly think Mars is 10
      meters farther than it actually is, we are likely to smack into it pretty hard when we get there.</p>

    <p class="tx">The world in which Oog and Ugh lived was a <em>rule of thumb</em> kind of world: Things were seven
      thumbs wide, or sometimes only three thumbs wide, more or less. They could not yet have dreamed there would one
      day be measuring instruments such as those we now take completely for granted&#8212;like chronometers on our
      wrists to tell us when the sun will appear, and the Global Positioning System to show us exactly where on the
      planet we are.</p>

    <p class="tx">In many ways, educational assessment is just now beginning to move beyond <em>rule of thumb</em>
      measurements. Like our cave-dwelling ancestors, we have yet to imagine the gauges and meters we might one day slap
      on our students&#39; foreheads to interface with the electrochemical activity of their brains and do our
      assessments. Nor have we yet invented an elegant <em>syst&#232;me internationale</em> for measuring learning. But,
      as this second edition illustrates, we are making enormous strides in developing effective ways of assessing
      students&#39; progress and of using feedback from these assessments to assist their learning.</p>

    <p class="tx">In its thoroughly updated and contemporary second edition, <em>Of Learning and Assessment</em> is a
      practical account of the current state of educational assessment and how it can be used to enhance learning as
      well as to summarize achievement. Its central theme is straightforward: Assessment is not just something that is
      done <em>to</em> students; it is something that is done <em>for</em> them. Assessment <em>for</em> learning is
      essential&#8212;as is assessment <em>of</em> learning. The thing is that assessment <em>of</em> learning has long
      been practiced; assessment <em>for</em> learning, not so much. Accordingly, this edition presents a solid
      foundation of current approaches to assessment with special emphasis on how assessment impacts the
      teaching&#8211;learning process. Much of its newer content reflects what is termed the <em>backward-design</em>
      approach to curriculum, assessment, and instruction. This approach underscores how learning goals, often based on
      widely accepted <em>common core</em> standards, are fundamentally important in determining assessment and
      instruction.</p>

    <p class="tx">When you have finished the book, perhaps you will be the one to begin to imagine calibrations and
      measurements of learning that no one has yet envisioned. Maybe it is you who will lead us out of the cave. It is
      not an entirely ridiculous thought.</p>
